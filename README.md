# python-datascience
This was my final project in Python course at university. 



It used Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib to do calculations on customer data 
then plots out numbers based on user input. 

Since the dataset is not public, i can only show the code that does the calculation in a gist:

It takes CSV data exported from Stripe and does a plot of monthly reccuring revenue. 
It also does calcualtions on invoices and debt collection, and shows how coivd19 affected business.
