# python-datascience
This was my final project in Python course at university. 

The project was to use a real company and do a project for them. 
The task was to do calculations on Customer data, sales, and Order data
from an online ecommerce clothes rental store. 

It used Python and the libaries Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib to do calculations on customer data 
then plots out numbers based on user input. 

It takes CSV data exported from Stripe and does a plot of monthly reccuring revenue. 
It also does calcualtions on invoices and debt collection, and shows how coivd19 affected business.
